    "# Using BigQuery and Google Drive as a Cloud Database. \n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "When working inside data mature organizations, the data is often stored in Relational Database Managemenst Systems, which makes it very easy to access the data as an analyst. When working on less matured organizations, or more often on personal project, the data is often very messy because it's stored in individual files. Not only does this makes analysis less reproducible, it makes it harder to manage since a milestone can be framed in terms of the content of a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "To remedy this, I explored the possibility of using a managed database on a cloud server (Google, Amazon, Azure, etc.) but was discouraged by the pricing conditions. Most of the uses I had in mind would not result in querying the data constantly. I wanted something simpler; like storing the data in Google Drive or Google Sheets. The problem with that is I would have to download the data each time I wanted to do something. Ideally, I could take a subset of the data for development and only query the whole thing when necessary. I don't mean something like reading the first few rows, rather the subset would be a proper filter on the data (e.g. for a specific country, or other where-like clauses).\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, I realized it was possible to query Google Sheets using something an SQL-like language. Even better, I eventually realized it was possible to link Google BigQuery to Google Sheets (or CSV Files) stored in Google Drive. This is a great solution because I can manage a data folder in my local PC, sync it to Google Drive, and use that as a way to share the data over the internet with myself when working on another computer, or with anyone who might want to reproduce the work I've done. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only downside is that BigQuery is a paid product. This isn't too much of a problem since, apparently, there's a free tier that allows up to 1 Terabyte of Query results to be transmitted. If I need to query the complete dataset, I can simply download it from Google Drive and leave BigQuery only for when strictly necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook I describe the basic functionality for reading the data once it's in BigQuery. "
